# Carbon-Footprint-Huella-de-Carbono

I worked on this project as part of my summer internship at a structural engineering firm in Uruguay. They wanted a method to estimate the carbon footprint of their projects, so I found data on carbon footprints of materials by a group called Circular Ecology. Their database had a lot of great information but it was hard to navigate, so I created a Python tool to allow an engineer to automatically enter the materials they plan on using for their project in order to recieve an estimated carbon footprint.

I made a rough draft in English, and then implemented automatic translation of the database into Spanish along with improved usability in a second version. Both are here. I also attached the database itself and instructions on how to use the tool. The instructions are in Spanish and I haven't had a chance to do a decent translation of them yet, but there are plenty of images and Google Translate should be good enough.
